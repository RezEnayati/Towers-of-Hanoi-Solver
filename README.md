# Towers of Hanoi Solver

### Project Description
This program implements a solver for the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The implementation uses recursion to find the optimal solution for moving disks from a starting pillar to a target pillar while following the standard rules of the game.

### Rules
1. There are three pillars (Pillar1, Pillar2, Pillar3)
2. N number of disks of increasing size (represented by integers)
3. All disks start stacked on one pillar
4. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk
5. All disks must be moved to the target pillar
6. Only one disk can be moved at a time

### Files Included
- `Hanoi.java`: Contains the main logic for solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle
- `Driver.java`: Contains the main method to run the program

### How to Compile and Run
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system
2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to the directory containing the source files
4. Compile the program:
5. Run the program:

### Usage
The Hanoi constructor takes three parameters:
- Number of disks (int)
- Start pillar number (1-3)
- Target pillar number (1-3)
